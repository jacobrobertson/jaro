#summary How to get started helping out with Jaro

= Roadmap =
I'm trying to capture the needs on the JaroRoadmap, and the [http://code.google.com/p/jaro/issues/list issues list].  Take a look there to see the general plan.

= Biggest Needs =
Right now, the thing that needs by far the most work is in creating professional looking graphics, and crowdsourcing the creation of lots of levels.  

== Graphics Needs ==
This includes splash screens, sprite icons, backgrounds, etc.
To help out with graphics, it's probably best that we get in touch and make a plan of action.  Email me at jacob.cs.robertson@gmail.com

== Crowdsourcing Levels ==
The first beta release contains less than 20 levels.  If I can marshal 10 people to each create 10 levels, that will go up dramatically.  See ContributeNewLevels for how to do this.  I'm hoping it's not too hard.

= Coding needs =
The basic game engine is in place, but there are a number of near-term improvements.  See the JaroRoadmap, and the [http://code.google.com/p/jaro/issues/list issues list].

Also, any other fixes and improvements should be welcome.

You can probably just open tickets, and submit patches, etc.  Also, feel free to email me at jacob.cs.robertson@gmail.com

= Rules Improvements =
I consider this the lowest priority, but it might also be a fun thing for developers to either contribute ideas or code to.  See RulesIdeas.
