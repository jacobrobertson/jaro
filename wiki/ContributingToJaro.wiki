#summary How to get started helping out with Jaro

== Roadmap ==

I'm trying to capture the needs on the JaroRoadmap, and the [http://code.google.com/p/jaro/issues/list issues list].  Take a look there to see the general plan.

The following sections list the needs in priority order.

== Graphics Needs ==

The number one need is to create professional looking graphics.  This includes splash screens, sprite icons, backgrounds, etc.
To help out with graphics, it's probably best that we get in touch and make a plan of action.  Email me at jacob.cs.robertson@gmail.com

== Crowdsourcing Levels ==

The number two need is creating additional levels.
The first beta release contains less than 20 levels.  If I can marshal 10 people to each create 10 levels, that will go up dramatically.  See ContributeNewLevels for how to do this.  I'm hoping it's not too hard.

== Coding needs ==

The basic game engine is in place, but there are a number of near-term improvements.  See the JaroRoadmap, and the [http://code.google.com/p/jaro/issues/list issues list].

Also, any other fixes and improvements should be welcome.

You can probably just open tickets, and submit patches, etc.  Also, feel free to email me at jacob.cs.robertson@gmail.com

== Rules Improvements ==
I consider this the lowest priority, but it might also be a fun thing for developers to either contribute ideas or code to.  See RulesIdeas.
