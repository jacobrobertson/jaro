#summary It is intended that levels are community created.

= Introduction =

All Jaro levels consist of an html file that has images laid out to look like a level.  The game parses that html file and creates the level.  The purpose behind this strategy is to make it easier for anyone to create a level.

If you're looking to do more than just add a level, see the home page (http://code.google.com/p/jaro/) to get started. 

= Version 1 of Level Maker =

Right now, version 1 of the level maker consists of following these steps on your own
 * Download the [http://code.google.com/p/jaro/source/browse/trunk/res/raw/level_builder_template.html html template]
 * Open the file with your favorite html editing program.
 * Add columns, rows; move icons around.
 * Look here for all the existing levels - this will show you how to do things.
  * http://code.google.com/p/jaro/source/browse
 * When you're done [http://code.google.com/p/jaro/issues/entry submit a new ticket] and attach your new level html file to that ticket.  Your level will be reviewed, and hopefully added to Jaro in the right stage.
